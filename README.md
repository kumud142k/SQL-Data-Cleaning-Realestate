# SQL-Data-Cleaning-Realestate

In this SQL project, I've cleaned the Nashville housing data for better analysis using intermediate to advanced SQL queries.

The Nashville data was available in Excel format. Data was imported into MS-SQL server and database was created.

Various data cleaning techniques were used in the process, Date format conversion, Null values imputation, STRING Formatting,removing duplicates etc.
